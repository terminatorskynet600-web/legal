# Privacy Policy

*Last updated: February 1, 2026*

## Introduction

This Privacy Policy explains how this Discord bot ("the Bot", "we", "us") handles information when you use our service.

## Information We Collect

**We do not collect, store, or process any personal data.**

The Bot operates on a stateless basis, meaning:
- No user data is saved to any database
- No message content is logged or stored
- No user IDs, usernames, or Discord data is retained
- No analytics or tracking is performed

## How the Bot Works

When you use a command (such as `/mission`), the Bot:
1. Receives your search query
2. Generates YouTube and GTA Wiki search links based on your input
3. Sends the response only to you (ephemeral message)
4. Immediately discards all information - nothing is stored

## Third-Party Services

The Bot generates links to external services:
- **YouTube** (youtube.com)
- **GTA Wiki** (gta.fandom.com)

When you click these links, you are subject to their respective privacy policies. We have no control over these third-party services.

## Data Shared with Discord

The Bot requires basic Discord permissions to function. Discord's own data practices are governed by [Discord's Privacy Policy](https://discord.com/privacy).

## Children's Privacy

The Bot does not knowingly collect any information from anyone, including children under 13 years of age.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Changes will be reflected in the "Last updated" date above.

## Data Controller

This Bot is operated by an individual developer. Since no personal data is collected or processed, data controller obligations under GDPR are minimal.

## Your Rights

Under GDPR, you have rights regarding your personal data, including access, correction, and deletion. Since this Bot does not collect or store any personal data, these rights do not apply in practice.
